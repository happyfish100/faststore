# the server group is a physical concept, the data under the same server group
# is the same (redundant or backup).
#
# the data group is a logical or virtual concept, its purpose is to facilitate
# cluster expansion.
#
# cluster expansion: migrate one or more data group(s) to one or more new server group(s).
# data migration: restart after the mappings from data group to server group modified,
# the data replication will be completed automatically.
#
# in order to facilitate cluster expansion, there is a one to many relationship
# between the server groups and the data groups.
# 1 : 64 (server groups : data groups) is recommended.
#
# data is hashed to the server group according to block hash code % the data groups.
# once the number of data groups is set, it can NOT be changed, otherwise
# the data access will be confused!

# the cluster, you MUST create a new cluster and migrate the data to it.
